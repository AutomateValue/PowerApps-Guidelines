## Title DH1202 <Recommended/>

This `Id` always bugged me, because of this simple fact - it's not an Id in code, it's a reference. So if you just wanted the `Id` in code you use this:

```csharp
var contactId = ((EntityReference)customMethod["dh_ContactId"]).Id;
```

Which I don't like, because you're repeating the abbreviation `Id`. In my opinion this kind of violates "DRY" so I will avoid it if at all possible. Using the new school way it looks cleaner without this repetition:
 
```csharp
var contactId = ((EntityReference)customMethod["dh_Contact"]).Id;
```
