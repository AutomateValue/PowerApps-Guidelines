# UX design

## 1 Understand what User eXperience design means

TODO: Explain what UX is, compared with UI.

What is this _UX_ thing anyway? It's not the same as User Interface design.

_User knowing how to use the system_ vs _system knowing what the **user** wants_

The human brain hates uncertainty - UX design can reduce uncertainty via:

- Choice reduction
- Visual cues
- Adapting to user interaction
- Following the user's natural process

User Experience is about the whole process

Why user experience is important for CRM systems:

- The frequency of user pain
    - Online store customer: temporary pain caused during the commercial transaction
    - CRM system user: continuous pain through repeated encounters with the dat-to-day tools
- The variety of use cases and user groups
    - People who don't share the same processes trying to use the same customer information system
    - Trying to deliver _sometething for everybody_ will results in monolithic enterpries software

Why its'especially important with Dynamics 365:

- Higher user expectations due to relative ease of out-of-the-box functionality
- Simplified UI only delivers benefits when the actions visible are the relevant ones
- Tons of new components to configure = more potential for UX sucess AND failure
